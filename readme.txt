Add different kind of input fields to your edit post page. Field can be of type textarea, TinyMCE, checkbox, radio buttons, drop downs or files.

== Description ==

Simple Fields for WordPress let you add groups of fields (aka "field groups") to you edit post page.
It is meant as a replacement for WordPress own custom fields.

Simple Fields turns WordPress into an even more powerful Content Management System (CMS).

#### Features and highlight

* Add textboxes, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and file browser to the post admin area
* Much easier for the user than regular custom fields
* Group fields together into logical groups. For example combine File + Name + Description into a an Attachments-group.
* Use "repeatable" field groups to add many any amount of field groups to a single post (great for images or attachments!)
* Use drag and drop to change order of added repeatable groups
* Different post types can use different field groups - actually you can even use different field groups even for same post type
* Nice GUI that looks like the rest of WordPress


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "simple-fields" to "/wp-content/plugins/"
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Done!


== Screenshots ==

1. A post in edit, showing two field groups: "Article options" and "Article images".
These groups are just example: you can create your own field groups with any combinatin for fields.
See that "Add"-link above "Article images"? That means that it is repeatable, so you can add as many images as you want to the post.

2. One field group being created (or modified).

3. Group field groups together and make them available for different post types.
